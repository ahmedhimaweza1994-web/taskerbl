# GWT Task Management System

## Overview

GWT Task Management is a comprehensive Arabic-language task and employee management system designed for companies. It provides real-time employee activity tracking through AUX status monitoring, task management with Kanban boards, HR management features, and analytics reporting. Built as a full-stack web application, it supports role-based access control for employees, sub-admins, and administrators. The project aims to streamline company operations and enhance employee oversight.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:** React 18 (TypeScript), Vite, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query (server state), Shadcn UI (components), Radix UI (primitives), Tailwind CSS (styling), Noto Sans Arabic (fonts).

**Design Patterns:** Component-based architecture, custom hooks, HOC for protected routes, Context API for global state, real-time updates via WebSockets.

**Key Features:** Dark mode, responsive design, Arabic localization, real-time data synchronization.

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Passport.js (authentication), Express sessions (PostgreSQL store), WebSocket server, Drizzle ORM.

**Authentication & Security:** Session-based authentication with secure HTTP-only cookies, bcrypt hashing, role-based access control (admin, sub-admin, employee), password reset.

**API Design:** RESTful API (`/api/*`), middleware for authentication and authorization, centralized error handling, request/response logging.

### Database Architecture

**Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon serverless).

**Schema Design:** Tables for users, AUX sessions, tasks, task collaborators, task notes, leave requests, notifications, and shifts. UUID primary keys, enum types for status fields, soft delete (`isActive`), timestamp tracking.

### State Management

**Client-Side:** TanStack Query for server state, React Context for authentication, local component state, localStorage for preferences.

**Real-Time Updates:** WebSocket connections for live status, query invalidation, optimistic updates, polling fallback.

## External Dependencies
